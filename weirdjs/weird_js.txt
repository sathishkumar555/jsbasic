Javascript:
    -syntax parsers
    -lexical environment
    -execution contexts--to check which lexical env is currently running (creation phase)
    -compliers->converting the code to machine understanding
    -Name-value or key-value pair in objects

Two Phase:
-creation phase
-execution phase

-Global execution context consist of global object(window) and this and outer environment.
-Javascript is  Single threaded and Sychronous in its execution
            Single threaded:
                        -one command at a time.
            Sychronous:
                        -execeute one at a time in order
-In global execution context, when we invoke the function it will create one more execution context.(stack event)
